.TH _PRINTF 3 "2024-05-22" "Holberton School" "Custom Printf Manual"
.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.sp
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf
function produces output according to a format as described below. It writes output to stdout, the standard output stream.
.sp
The function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.SH FORMAT
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
.sp
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
The following conversion specifiers are supported:
.TP
.B c
The \fIint\fR argument is converted to an \fIunsigned char\fR, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
The \fIconst char *\fR argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) the terminating null byte ('\0').
.TP
.B %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
.TP
.B d, i
The \fIint\fR argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.SH EXAMPLES
_printf("Character:[%c]\\n", 'H');
.br
_printf("String:[%s]\\n", "I am a string !");
.br
_printf("Percent:[%%]\\n");
